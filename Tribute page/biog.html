        <!-- <article class="flow-text">
        Johann Sebastian Bach, born on March 21, 1685, in Eisenach, Germany, was a musical luminary whose legacy
        extended far beyond his own lifetime. Growing up in a family deeply rooted in music, Bach's early exposure to
        the art form set the stage for his extraordinary career.
        <br>
        <br>

        Orphaned at the age of 10, Bach's resilience and talent paved the way for a remarkable journey in music. As an
        organist in various towns, including Arnstadt and Mühlhausen, he honed his craft and developed a unique musical
        voice. It was during his time in Weimar that he began to establish himself as a composer of considerable
        prowess.
        <br>        <br>


        In Cöthen, Bach's focus shifted to instrumental compositions, and he produced some of his most celebrated works,
        such as the Brandenburg Concertos. His tenure in Leipzig, where he served as Cantor at St. Thomas Church, marked
        a period of prolific choral compositions, including the Mass in B Minor and the St. Matthew Passion.
        <br>        <br>


        While Bach's contributions to music are monumental, his personal life was equally dynamic. Married twice, first
        to Maria Barbara Bach and then to Anna Magdalena Wilcken, Bach was the father of twenty children, ten of whom
        survived to adulthood. Several of his children, including Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl Philipp Emanuel, and Johann
        Christian, went on to become respected composers in their own right, collectively contributing to the musical
        landscape of the 18th century.
        <br>        <br>


        Bach's influence extends beyond his individual compositions; it permeates through the generations of musicians
        who followed, including his own talented offspring. His dedication to his craft, innovative spirit, and profound
        understanding of harmony and counterpoint continue to inspire amateurs and professionals alike. Johann Sebastian
        Bach's musical legacy is not only a testament to his genius but also a familial and generational gift to the
        world of classical music.        <br>
